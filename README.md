## 🛠️ My Process

Before jumping into the code, I took a moment to plan things out. Thinking through the layout and structure helped me write cleaner and more organized code. ✍️🧠

### 🧱 Built With

- ✅ Semantic HTML5 markup
- 🎨 CSS custom properties
- 🧩 BEM naming convention
- 📐 Flexbox
- 🧱 CSS Grid
- 📱 Mobile-first workflow

### 📚 What I Learned

This was my third Frontend Mentor challenge. While similar to the first two, it helped reinforce the fundamentals of HTML and CSS. Nothing new in particular this time, but solid practice nonetheless! 💪

### 🔄 Continued Development

I'm focusing more on:

- Achieving _pixel-perfect_ design using Figma and the Pixel Perfect Pro extension
- Improving my responsive design skills
- Mastering layout techniques
